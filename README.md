# MaxNDB

MaxNDB is a powerful, constraint-aware optimization database system that combines advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with scalable vector database integration. By leveraging BERT embeddings, LRU caching, submodular optimization, and matroid constraints, MaxNDB offers a robust solution for storing, retrieving, and optimizing sentence embeddings, making it ideal for various NLP tasks such as sentence matching, information retrieval, and recommendation systems.

## Features

- **BERT-based Sentence Embeddings**: MaxNDB uses state-of-the-art BERT models to generate high-dimensional embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of sentences.
- **LRU Caching**: Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache to optimize memory usage and improve retrieval speed.
- **Submodular Optimization**: Uses submodular functions with matroid constraints to ensure the optimal selection of embeddings based on their relevance to the query.
- **Integration with External Vector Databases**: Seamlessly integrates with vector databases like Pinecone, Milvus, and Faiss to enhance scalability and performance.
- **Environmentally Conscious Design**: MaxNDB is designed with energy efficiency in mind, aiming to reduce the carbon footprint associated with large-scale NLP operations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run MaxNDB on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (latest stable version) - Required for building and running the Rust application.
- **Python 3.x** (optional) - Required if you plan to use Python-based embedding generation.
- **Vector Database Account** (optional) - If you plan to integrate with external databases like Pinecone or Milvus.

### Installing

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maxndb.git
   cd maxndb
